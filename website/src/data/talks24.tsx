                <h3> AI-Driven Breakthroughs in Plasmid DNA Production</h3> <br/>
        <Row>
           <p>Ram Shankar, from Plasmid Factory, gave an insightful talk about the integration of AI and advanced biotechnology, with a focus on plasmid DNA production. His presentation highlighted how AI-driven innovations have transformed research methodologies in gene therapy, plasmid manufacturing, and DNA purification. His speech showcased the practical applications of AI in streamlining workflows, making biotech processes more efficient and scalable.</p>
            <p>Shankar began by illustrating how scientific advancements, such as powered flight and DNA research, have rapidly progressed within a single human lifetime. He connected this concept to breakthroughs in plasmid DNA technology, where Plasmid Factory’s work has been pivotal in advancing gene therapy products. A key takeaway was the integration of AI in optimizing plasmid purification processes, enabling the production of high-quality plasmids and mini circles for clinical applications. Shankar also introduced real-world examples, such as the use of AI in enhancing the stability and quality of gene vectors and mRNA production. His discussion of collaborations between academia and industry underscored the importance of networking and shared innovation, comparing it to the historic partnership between Stanley Cohen and Herbert Boyer that revolutionized recombinant DNA technology.</p>
                <p>The talk provided attendees with a deeper understanding of how AI can revolutionize lab work, particularly in scaling up DNA production for gene therapies. By applying these insights, participants left with ideas on how to leverage AI to enhance their own research projects, particularly in biotechnology and gene editing.</p>

                            <p>The meet-up started off with a warm welcome and the first team challenge: The campus quest. Teams had to orient themselves on our campus composed of numerous faculties. With complementary refreshments they started their adventure at campus Riedberg.</p>
                            <p>Once everyone arrived, we officially welcomed everyone, introduced the entire team on stage and informed everyone on safety throughout the event. Everyone should have the best time possible. We then turned the spotlight to our special guest, Nemanja Stijepovic, CEO and president of the iGEM foundation, who gave a captivating talk on “Inside iGEM: Beyond the BioBrick”. </p>
                            <p>BioBrick and prizes? This is where we are all heading. But how did past teams get there? In the BFH Path of the legends lecture series iGEM alumni gave the audience the opportunity to learn from real iGEM success stories. Among which were former BFH participants and last year’s finalists from iGEM team Marburg and iGEM team Aachen. This lecture series accompanied us throughout the entire event.</p>

                    <p>Afterwards, the Lab Olympics invited everyone to break the ice and take part in exciting lab-themed mini games. After challenging games everyone could network even more at our complementary Cookout. The day ended with the award ceremony from the Campus Quest and the Lab Olympics honoring those that became Frankfurt experts as well as champions of our laboratory-themed minigames.</p>
