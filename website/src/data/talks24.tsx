                    <h3> Secrets to award-winning bioinformatics tools</h3> <br/>
                    <Row>
                        <p>
                            Lasse’s Ted talk was all about how to create good bioinformatics software. He himself was part of the dry lab in iGEM Münster’s Team that won the best software special prize in 2022. The tool they created allowed users to generate knockout candidates for an organism of their choice that would lead to redirection of metabolic flux to a reaction chosen by the user. We learned that the most important attributes for a successful bioinformatics software are:
                        </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Usefulness</li>
                            <li>Accessibility</li>
                            <li>Build upon existing standards </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>
                            To ensure usefulness, the software should be generalized and not only usable in the context of one’s own project. Also, all steps that can be automated should be automated. Accessibility, Lasse said, requires for the software to be easy to install, easy to use and well documented.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            As a funny, but also very fitting anecdote, Lasse told us about the HU test. For testing their own tool for accessibility, he gave a bioinformatically unexperienced, hungover undergraduate student nothing but the software with the provided documentation. If the student can use the tool in a reasonable amount time, that would make it accessible enough for everyone. Furthermore, Lasse also recommended making a command line tool for better availability over time and integration into other workflows. Lastly, the software should use standard data files like CSV, Fasta etc. and be written in commonly used programming languages like Python.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Overall, Lasse gave a great insight into the properties of a special price winning software tool and very practically explained how these can be tested and achieved, information that is invaluable for us when creating our own bioinformatics tool.

                               Merel provided us with strategies based on her cELPro project at TU Eindhoven on how to approach winning the special awards for Composite Part and New Basic Part. Her team won the <a href={"https://2023.igem.wiki/tu-eindhoven/awards"}>Composite Part Prize and the Therapeutic Prize</a> at the 2023 iGEM competition.
                           </p>
                           <p>
                               After presenting her team's project, Merel inspired us with ways we could also achieve this award. We learned different considerations to make, when it comes to part characterization:
                           </p>
                       </Col>

                                />
                            </Figure>
                        </Col>
                    </Row>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How to emphasize the innovativeness of the project</li>
                        <li>How to highlight the parts potential benefits </li>
                        <li>How to discuss whether these parts could be applied to other projects</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Many projects fail because the experiments conducted are too complex. Therefore, Merel encouraged us to initially carry out simpler experiments for our projects, like pH sensitivity and temperature response. Opening the mindset for other maybe more pragmatic experiments could change the focus of the project and drive the engineering cycle.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Additionally, she showed us what a perfect submission for New Basic Part or Composite Part looks like. The Best Part Registry demonstrates great significance and should be filled with different results and representative analyses to characterize the parts. Conducting experiments for characterization and good documentation are just two aspects. The most crucial part is the demonstration of the part’s functions as intended.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        We learned what effective strategies for the special awards Composite Part and New Basic Part might look like, and were provided with many helpful tips and tricks on how simple experiments for characterization could be designed.

                    <h3> ChatGPT and Large Language Models </h3> <br/>
                    <Row>

                    </Row>
                    <p>
                        With Jonas Vaquet, a research associate of the EU project ERC Waterfutures, the audience explored Large Language Models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT. The speaker humorously engaged the crowd, asking who had used such models, and nearly all hands were raised in response.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The speaker introduced ChatGPT, a "Generative Pre-trained Transformer," using an interactive experiment where the audience predicted the next words in sentences, showing how the model works with pre-trained data and calculates text continuations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While it is fair to say that ChatGPT is a powerful and helpful tool, it is important to focus on the potential dangers and challenges it brings, which Jonas summarizes in three key factors in his talk:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>
                                Plagiarism Risks:
                            </b>
                            the speaker demonstrated how easy it is to unintentionally replicate existing works, using a Harry Potter example to illustrate plagiarism risks in creative writing.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>
                                Hallucinations:
                            </b>
                            Language models can generate plausible but incorrect information, exemplified by a fictitious CV with invented grades, highlighting risks in academic and professional use.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>
                                Lack of Opinion Formation:
                            </b>
                            ChatGPT does not form real opinions, leading to inconsistent answers when asked for preferences.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Although large language models (LLMs) are trained with extensive collection of texts or spoken language, they often fail in the accuracy required for scientific topics. Sources are seemingly conjured out of thin air and claims vanish into thin air because their answers are based on statistical probabilities, leading to confusion, especially for niche questions.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Jonas ended his talk by giving the audience food for thought. He reminded everyone who had eagerly raised their hands at the beginning to always double-check ChatGPT's information, especially in academic and professional settings.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        With his interactive and humorous approach, Jonas turned the complex world of LLMs into an engaging and accessible adventure, offering deep insights into the workings and idiosyncrasies of this fascinating technology.

                        With insights into his current research, Niklas introduced the audience to the innovative uses of chlorella for sustainable food production.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The star of the show was the smallest vegetable in the world Chlorella is tiny (4 to 12 microns) but very rich in nutrients: 45-65% protein, 10-20% fat, 10-20% carbohydrates, 5% fiber and various vitamins and minerals, including vitamin B12.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Nicholas presented two production methods:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            open pond systems: these utilize light, CO₂ and water for photosynthesis, but have the problem of the availability of light and water.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            bioreactors: modern, controlled, sterile environments that utilize sugar as an energy source, significantly increase productivity and reduce water consumption.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Bioreactors are up to 100 times more productive and use 100 times less water than conventional methods. Sounds perfect, right? But Nicholas had to burst the bubble and make it clear that the technology still needs to be developed further.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In terms of sustainability, Nicholas had to emphasize that the whole process of microalgae production needs to be questioned. He noted that the current carbon footprint calculations for bioreactors are outdated. But fear not, our brave biotechnologist is on a mission to bring these figures up to date with his groundbreaking research!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The curious audience asked questions about scalability, costs and sustainable sugar sources. Always up for a challenge, Nicholas explained that the current high costs could be addressed by improving the productivity of the bioreactors! However, he also emphasized that further research is needed to find a sustainable source of sugar.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In his grand finale, Nicholas presented three wise insights:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            biotechnology goes far beyond medicine and opens the doors for sustainable food production.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            sustainability assessments must consider the entire production process - no detail should be overlooked!
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            chlorella, the tiny, nutrient-rich microalgae, has the potential to be a hero in our future diet.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        Nicholas captivated the audience with his vivid and eye-opening presentation. He guided them through the fascinating and sometimes turbulent world of microalgae production, highlighting the challenges and opportunities of this technology. The audience was not only informed but also entertained and ready to embrace the future of sustainable nutrition with chlorella as their little green hero.

            <p>The session began with an introduction to color theory tools such as Realtime Colors and AI Colors, emphasizing their role in creating visually
                appealing designs. Typography was a key focus, clarifying the difference between typeface (e.g., Futura) and font variations (e.g., Futura Condensed),
                and how font weights and sizes impact readability and design hierarchy. Practical guidelines, including the usage of different types of units such as
                PX or REM for font sizing and understanding spacing for an effective layout, were given. </p>
            <p>
                We delved into HTML's structure for web content, learning semantic tags for effectively organizing information. CSS principles were explored next,
                demonstrating how styles cascade from parent to child elements, which are crucial for consistent design across a webpage.
                A significant part of the workshop involved hands-on coding in Visual Studio Code, where we replicated a pre-designed webpage using the HTML and CSS
                techniques learned. This exercise equipped the attending iGEM teams with practical skills to create and style their own project websites and emphasized
                the importance of component-based design and effective content organization.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the end of the workshop, the attendees were inspired to pursue creating their own wikis, leveraging AI-based tools like for initial designs and imagery.
                Overall, we left with a solid foundation in web development and were prepared to build professional and functional websites for their iGEM projects.

            <h3>How to Synthetic Biology? - Introducing Kernel Software. </h3>
            <p>
                The kernel workshop was given by Traci Haddock, Director of Community at <a href="https://www.asimov.com/">ASIMOV Boston</a>. She introduced the Kernel software and showed us how to
                implement AI-based tools in our synthetic biology project. The program can be used to graphically display plasmids. By uploading parts in an
                iGEM-related database, safety considerations and registry entries can be checked automatically.

            </div>
            <h6>What did we learn?</h6>
            <p>
                We learned the basics of kernels in order to design plasmids by understanding general plasmid construction and problem solving through different
                cloning strategies. </p>
            <p>
                Furthermore, Kernel has an AI-assisted search function that can be used for plasmid representation, e.g. to find a specific
                promoter based on certain requirements. Traci showed us practical exercises for firsthand application. First, we were asked to
                recreate a plasmid followed by a slightly trickier task: We should clean the world of major marshmallow contamination by developing
                a plasmid.  In small groups we discussed which components the plasmid needed. Tracy gave us some information with which we quickly
                identified crucial components of the plasmid and then designed it.
            </p>
            <p>In the end, each group presented their solution. The funniest and most creative approaches were celebrated. </p>

                and open new opportunities for innovation.
            </p>
            <p>
                The workshop was structured around two main components: theoretical insights and a practical group exercise. In the theory portion, we gained a deeper
                understanding of AI applications, including neuro-symbolic AI and its role in enhancing research methodologies. The instructors shared their experiences
                developing AI tools like those at xyna.bio, offering participants valuable knowledge on the AI development process.
            </p>
            <p>During the group work, we brainstormed ideas for AI tools that could simplify lab work for scientists. This activity not only fostered creative
                thinking but also encouraged collaboration, as we discussed potential AI solutions that could streamline tasks like data analysis and experimental
                design.
            </p>
            <p>
                By the end of the workshop, participants walked away with practical insights and actionable skills. We felt equipped to start implementing AI
                solutions in our own research projects, identifying specific areas where AI could improve efficiency and productivity in the lab.

            <h3>About Dual-use and Biosafety</h3>
            <p>
                The biosafety workshop was held by Svenja Vinke. As a postdoctoral researcher specializing in synthetic biology at the Church Lab, Harvard Medical School. Svenja works on the iGEM Safety and Security Committee. Additionally, she was part of the Biosafety and Security Award Team of Bielefeld University in 2016.
            </p>
            <p>
                First and foremost, she started the workshop by outlining the key concepts of biosafety and biosecurity, emphasizing how important laboratory safety is.
            </p>
            <div className="row">

                </div>
            </div>
            <br/>
            <p>She also explained which safety aspects we should consider for our project:  </p>
            <ul>
                <li> <b>Dual use:</b> Refers to technology or research that can be used for both beneficial and harmful purposes. For example, AI designed for medical diagnosis could also be misused for harmful surveillance. Managing dual-use risks involves careful consideration of both the positive applications and the potential for misuse. </li>
                <li> <b>Built-In Safety Levels:</b>      This concept involves designing systems with multiple layers of safety to prevent failure or minimize harm. In technology and engineering, built-in safety levels ensure that even if one layer fails, others remain intact to maintain safe operation. </li>
                <li>  <b>Safe-by-Design: </b>  Safe-by-Design emphasizes integrating safety considerations into the earliest stages of product or system development. By anticipating risks and hazards from the start, this approach proactively minimizes dangers before they become issues, leading to safer outcomes.  </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Finally, each team gave brief presentations of their projects and engaged in a group discussion on potential security risks and general security considerations. Together, we brainstormed and identified specific aspects of each project that could present potential risks.
            </p>
            <p>
                From Svenja’s seminar, we learned which safety-relevant aspects are particularly important, as well as the importance of examining a project from different perspectives to identify and minimize potential risks related to lab work and the environment.

            <h3>Effective Science Communication: Strategies for Success</h3>
                <p>
                    This workshop was offered to us by StudSciCom as part of the BFH Meet-up program at Bielefeld University.
                    <a href="https://www.stud-scicom.de/"> StudSciCom</a> is an initiative for science communication by students for students in Germany.
                    They held this workshop for us for the very
                    first time and we are glad that we were able to offer the uprising StudSciCom team a platform to try out this kind of outreach. In addition,
                    we were able to gain knowledge about proper science communication – a clear win-win situation for all of us!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Science communication is defined as the practice of informing, educating, and raising awareness about science-related topics among the general public
                    or specific audiences. It involves various methods such as writing articles, giving presentations, using social media, and engaging in public discussions
                    to make scientific knowledge accessible and understandable<a href=""></a>.

                </p>
                <h6>What did we learn?</h6>
                <p>
                    Julia Kalinowski, PhD at Bielefeld University and Foreign Minister of StudSciCom, together with Carolin Malmendier,
                    former physics student and now organizer in the StudSciCom team, introduced us to the theories and  practice
                    of different types of science communication and how to develop a communication strategy.
                    In detail, we were taught to ask ourselves several questions to define our topic, the medium of
                    communication, as well as the characterization of our target group and the planned achievement with our
                    science communication.
                </p>
                <img src="https://static.igem.wiki/teams/5247/photos/other/vortrag-scicom-bfh-screenshot.jpg"></img>
                <p>The key message for us was to plan the science communication before we dive in and to make sure that the
                    target audience gets the message we want to send.  </p>
                <h6>Implementation</h6>
                <p>
                    Afterwards, the attending iGEM teams talked about their science communication plans and how they could improve them
                    using the skills learned in this workshop. Our team revised their plans for explaining gene editing to
                    children and started developing experiments to help them better understand Cystic Fibrosis, which we
                    presented later onto the public at <a >“Der Teuto ruft!”</a>, an event in Bielefeld to connect the local
                    population with regional companies and institutes to inform them about their work - including our iGEM team!

                <li>    Crafting compelling narratives to present complex ideas clearly and engagingly, ensuring they remain memorable for the audience. </li>
                <li>    Structuring and organizing pitches to highlight critical elements such as innovation, market potential, and team strengths, thus communicating your message effectively. </li>
                <li>    Tailoring pitches to resonate with different target audiences, including investors and collaborators, making them adaptable and impactful. </li>
                <li>    Building confidence and mastering persuasive techniques to convincingly communicate the value of your project. </li>
                <li>    Utilizing creative and visually appealing pitch materials, with a focus on integrating visuals and data effectively to enhance the presentation. </li>
            </ol>
            <p>Madeleine Mussgnug delivered these insights through a balanced mix of presentation and interactive discussions. She provided real-world examples and engaged the audience by prompting them to reflect on specific techniques, images, and stylistic choices. For instance, she demonstrated the strategic use of numbers and icons on slides, discussing how their size and placement can influence the viewer’s perception. By showing different slide constellations, she encouraged the audience to discuss their visual impact. The workshop concluded with a focus on the importance of networking. According to Mussgnug, knowing whom to approach and how to engage with them is key—this, she emphasized, is the essence of successful pitching. </p>
            <p>We immediately put what we learned into practice in various areas, such as: </p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Meet-up Münster Presentation:</b>    We adopted a fresh, innovative approach when preparing for the Münster meet-up, integrating many of the techniques from the workshop. </li>
                <li><b>Correspondence with Potential Partners and Sponsors: </b>    Our communication became more targeted and effective, allowing us to build stronger connections with potential partners and sponsors. </li>
                <li><b>Improved Steering Committee Communication:</b>    We also saw a noticeable improvement in our interactions with the steering committee, using clearer and more persuasive messaging. </li>
            </ul>
            <p>In essence, the workshop not only enhanced our pitching skills but also significantly improved our overall communication strategies, enabling us to present our ideas with greater confidence and impact. </p>
