                Cellective is a riboswitch-based therapeutic platform that selectively targets cancer cells by
                detecting specific microRNAs and mRNAs, subsequently translating a cellular kill system. This
                platform is intended to be further developed specifically for the treatment of triple-negative
                breast cancer (TNBC), a particularly aggressive and hard-to-treat form of breast cancer.
                The selective detection of cancer-specific marker RNAs using the engineered riboswitch RNAs
                enables a highly specific, minimally invasive therapy that spares healthy cells and is only
                activated in tumor-relevant contexts. The modular design allows for flexible adaptation to
                different tumor types and RNA profiles, allowing personalized medicine. We successfully
                engineered this therapeutic system and confirmed its functionality.

                    PreCyse is a next-generation Prime Editing technology, an innovative gene therapy approach for
                    Cystic Fibrosis (CF) specifically targeting the most common mutation F508del of the CFTR gene.
                    Cystic Fibrosis is a severe disorder that primarily affects the lungs and for which only
                    short-term symptomatic treatments exist. PreCyse aims to provide long-term relief by delivering
                    a small genetic payload with speed and precision. Our approach integrates PrimeGuide, a highly
                    optimized Prime Editing system, with AirBuddy, a novel lipid nanoparticle (LNP) delivery
                    platform. The SORT LNPs used in AirBuddy are optimized for pulmonary delivery, offering precise
                    organ targeting and structural stability throughout the inhalation process. Small payload size
                    is key for effective delivery and compatibility with viral vectors, which have a limited
                    capacity. PrimeGuide embodies this vision by utilizing a smaller, more efficient editing
                    complex. Current treatments often require daily administration whereas PreCyse is currently
                    developed as a monthly applied therapy. In addition, Prime Editing holds the promise to offer a
                    causal cure, when mutations are corrected in stem cells. Our approach aims to reduce medication
                    frequency while improving patient outcomes. By lowering costs and improving accessibility,
                    PreCyse aspires to offer an advanced and user-friendly cure for Cystic Fibrosis.

                    abstract={"Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most prevalent inherited disease. Inactivating mutations in the Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR) gene lead to the accumulation of viscous mucus and subsequent respiratory complications. This study optimized a prime editing (PE) approach to correct CFTR mutations focusing on the F508del mutation. Prime editing allowed to introduce missing bases without double-strand breaks using a Cas9-nickase fused with a reverse transcriptase in combination with a prime editing guide RNA (pegRNA). Various self-designed pegRNAs were compared. For delivery, various lipid nanoparticles (LNP) were tested, which were optimized for stability and lung cells targeting based on lipid selection or chitosan complexion. A fluorescence reporter system, pPEAR_CFTR, was developed mimicking F508del for validation. The five pegRNAs yielding the highest efficiency were used for genomic CFTR correction in a CF bronchial cell line. Nanopore sequencing of genomic DNA revealed approximate 5% edited reads. These results highlight the promise of prime editing-LNP systems for precise and lung-specific gene correction, paving the way for novel therapies in cystic fibrosis and other pulmonary genetic disorders."}
