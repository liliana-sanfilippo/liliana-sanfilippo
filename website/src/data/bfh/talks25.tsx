            <h3>Pitch it like it’s hot</h3>
            <p>By Martha Carolina Elizondo Cantú and Anthony Ao</p>
            <p>This interactive workshop equips iGEM teams with the skills to pitch their synthetic biology projects
                with confidence and clarity. Hosted by iGEM Startups & the German Association for Synthetic Biology
                (GASB), the session will guide participants through the essentials of entrepreneurship, effective
                science communication, storytelling, and value-driven project framing. Teams will have the opportunity
                to present their pitches and receive personalized feedback from a panel of mentors, including experts
                from Invitris, GASB, iGEM Startups, and iGEM Alumni. Outstanding pitches will be awarded exclusive
                tickets to SynBioReactor 2026, GASB’s premier synthetic biology conference. Ideal for early-stage teams
                looking to sharpen their message and amplify their impact.</p>

            <h3>How to Wiki? - CSS and HTML Crash Course</h3>
            <p>By Christian Kolland</p>
            <p>In this 90-minute hands-on workshop, participants will learn the basics of HTML and CSS by building
                simple, reusable elements for Wiki pages. After a brief introduction and setting up a project using
                Visual Studio Code, we’ll cover key concepts in a short introductory talk. The main focus will be a live
                demo where we create a navigation bar step by step. If time permits, participants will design a card
                component based on a visual example. This session is ideal for beginners and emphasizes doing over
                theory.</p>

            <h3>Patent right - Save your Intellectual Property!</h3>
            <p>By Dr. Jan Hiort</p>
            <p>This workshop introduces early-stage iGEM teams and synthetic biology innovators to the fundamentals of
                intellectual property protection under European patent law. Designed for those just beginning to shape
                their ideas, the session will cover how to identify patentable aspects of synthetic biology projects,
                including engineered organisms, genetic circuits, and biosystems. Participants will learn about patent
                eligibility, disclosure requirements, and how to navigate the European Patent Convention (EPC). With
                practical tips on protecting early innovations and avoiding common pitfalls, this workshop empowers
                young researchers to integrate IP strategy into their project development from the start.</p>

            <h3>Pipeline Design</h3>
            <p>By Julian Borbeck and Johannes Høgsbro Friis</p>
            <p>XYNA.BIO presents a 90-minute workshop, designed for minds that want to leverage computational methods in
                chemistry and biology. The workshop will teach you how to utilize bioinformatic tools with ease and
                scalability through *pipelines*. You’ll learn how to construct pipelines and source biological data for
                the technique ‘*Molecular Docking'*. Participants will first explore the foundational concepts: what is
                a pipeline and its role in modern research. This will be followed by a practical demonstration of
                molecular docking, showcasing pipeline construction using the platform xyna.bio. Next up is a hands-on
                group competition where attendees will design their own pipeline to address a challenge: Optimizing
                ligand affinity to the Cannabinoid receptor. The group with the most potent ligand wins a price.
                Participants will leave with an understanding of how bioinformatics analysis can be seamlessly
                integrated into the wet-lab. A valuable skill in the age of advanced computing.</p>

            <h3>How to Communicate Science</h3>
            <p>By Julia Grass</p>
            <p>This workshop introduces participants to the fundamentals of effective science communication across
                different audiences and platforms. Attendees will learn how to distill complex ideas into clear,
                engaging messages without sacrificing accuracy. Through interactive exercises, they will practice
                storytelling, visual communication, and tailoring content for public, academic, and media contexts. The
                session also explores common pitfalls and strategies for building trust and impact as a science
                communicator. Ideal for scientists, students, and iGEM teams looking to amplify the reach and relevance
                of their work.</p>
