# Sciebo

We have an iGEM Sciebo. It is a project box that currrently belongs to me. The file structure is as follows (as of Feb. 2026):

```
Home (level 0)
|
└── iGEM Bielefeld (level 1)
  |
  ├── Archive
  |    └── [folders from former teams] 
  |
  └── iGEM[currentyear] (level 2)
    ├── Team Start
    ├── Orga
    ├── Finances
    ├── ...
```
Of course, teams can alter the structure to their taste. 

## Access rights

- Level 0 is only visible to people with the password. 
- Level 1 is permanently shared with the PI.
- Level 2 is shared with the current team. 

Files, calenders, averything can be shared with other users or (more easily) with **teams** of people. 
We are using the "share with team" function as then only the team members have to be managed and not all individual access rights. 

Depending on the privacy setting, a person may have to first accept an invitation to a team to be accepted into the team. These invitations are sent through email to the uni-bielefeld mail (usually). 

### Managing teams 


## Further uses of sciebo

We formerly used Microsoft Teams, which was problematic in some aspects. Most functions of Teams are available in Sciebo. There are further features not (freely) available in Teams such as the calendar, tasks and overleaf. 

### Shared Calendar

The igembielefeld box has a personal calender which is not in use and a calender called "iGEM".

It is shared with the current team and through the sharable links, one can "subscribe" to the calender on other devices such as their phone.

The calender can, as most calenders, be used with a month-, week- and day-view. Tasks from the "iGEM" task list with deadlines are visible in the calendar as well.

### Polls

It is possible to create polls via the igembielefeld box, but more practical to have people create polls with their own sciebo accounts. They can be used for simple queries such as a meeting date, an activity decision for team building, etc.

As everything else, polls can easyly be shared with teams and external people.

<img width="300"  alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6e7fa4a-d970-4ae5-b9f8-ee3550e4cf5d" />

There are several options available for the polls:

<img width="300"  alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9f7e1a62-283f-4348-8771-548bc5a8ff18" />

Results can be downloaded in various forms.

### Forms

Forms can be used for more complex queries such as getting the information for the team profiles together, longer stakeholder polls, etc. They can be shared alike.

And options:

And the results can be downloaded in various forms as well:

### Tasks 

The tasks feature is good-ish but it is not possible to assign tasks to specific people, only share the task list (that belogns to the iGEM Calender) with individuals or teams. But the **task board** (deck) allows this and is meant for project management.  

<img width="582" height="203" alt="grafik" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bdcc9b8a-d33b-4d60-8619-f53dcd34a0ad" />


### Deck

The deck is a project management board that uses "cards" instead of typical "task items". The task lists are presented as boards:

Cards can be assigned to people or groups, tags and notes can be added and it is possible to link documents, which can be very handy for text review later on.
