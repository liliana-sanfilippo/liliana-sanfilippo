# Starting with Geneious Prime

To use Geneious Prime, you must install it, activate the license, and log in to the database.
Once you have installed Geneious Prime, you can open it by clicking on the Geneious Prime icon in your desktop or system tray.

>  **Note:** of course this is only possible if the team received a Geneious sponsorship

## How to activate prime

Install the software on your computer https://www.geneious.com/download/ or, in the CeBiTec system, it is installed 
under `/vol/geneious` and can be started using the command
  `/vol/geneious/bin/geneious`.

Create an account in the downloaded application (not online!) using your university email address. Activate your  
premium features with the licence provided (changes every year). 

## Access to the database

> **Important:** You have to be in the CeBiTec network (through the VPN or Thinlinc) to be granted access. 
> **Using Eduroam is not enough!**

Then when Geneious is open: 

1. Click on `Files`
2. `New Database Connection`
3. Enter credentials 
    * Your CeBiTec name
    * Your CeBitec password 
    * The database is called `geneious_igem2023` 
    * The server is called `mysql.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de`
    * Database type is `MySQL`
4. Done


## Perquisites

>  **Note:** You of course need a CeBiTec account! 


Information on how to use the VPN:

Using Thinlinc simply means logging in remotely to a CeBiTec computer.

I don't know how it works if you want to use Blast or something like that on your own computer via Geneious. It 
might overwhelm the computing capacity of a small laptop.
Try it out, and if it crashes or freezes, you'll just have to do it via Thinlinc.


## Deactivating licences 

It  is possible to free licences through the Geneious software.
