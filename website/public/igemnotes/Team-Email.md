# Getting access to the shared team email

(as of 2025)

> **Important:** You have to contact the CeBiTec support (or me) to have your account added to the permitted users. 

## Webmail (browser)

Log in at https://webmail.cebitec.uni-bielefeld.de/ with your own email address. You do not need to enter the
"verification code". And you're done!

## Thunderbird (all operating systems)

-> Log in with your own CeBiTec email address and password.

Then, under the folders (Inbox, Spam, etc.) in the left-hand sidebar, there should be a folder called
"Beschreibungen". When you open it, there is a subfolder called "Other Users", which
in turn has a subfolder called "igem-info". This is the iGem inbox.

### Problem: Subfolders are not visible

That is because they are not visible. 

-  Go to "Settings" und "Server Settings"
- Gehe zu den erweiterten Einstellungen 
- Uncheck the box next to "Show subscribed folders only".


The iGem folder should now be visible.

## Geary (Linux)

- Click on Add account. 
- Enter your CeBiTec address as your email address. 
- Enter your CeBiTec name as your login name. 
- Enter your CeBiTec password as your password.

Then, in the sidebar on the left, under the folders (Inbox, Spam, etc.), there should be a folder called
"Descriptions". When you open it, there is a subfolder called "Other Users", which
in turn has a subfolder called "igem-info". This is the iGem inbox.

### Problem: I cannot send emails from the iGEM address, only from my own


- Go to "Accounts"
- Select the CeBiTec account
- Only your own email address should be listed under "Email addresses" – click on the "+" to add one 
- Sender name: iGem Team Bielefeld 
- Email address: team[year]@igem-bielefeld.de

> **Note:** A new yearly address has to be requested from the CeBiTec support, it is not automatically available. 

You should now be able to select the iGem email address when sending emails. Or just use your own email to answer. 

If it does not work and it is important, contact me to get the login info for the info@ email to send directly from 
there.
